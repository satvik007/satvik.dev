Recently I have been quite interested in the frontend space. The inspiration has certainly come from dev twitter.
After exploring different frontend projects as well as tooling, I decided to work on my own site and a blog.
I got my domain from [Google domains](https://domains.google.com/registrar/).


For the frontend framework, I am using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which is a full stack React framework.
Next.js provides a lot of features and is a great choice for a blog.
With a very little learning curve, I get pretty much the best developer experience and performance.
Try clicking on any links in this website, everything will feel very snappy.
This happens because Next.js has prefetched all the pages you are going to visit.
It also reduces bundle sizes by doing automatic [code splitting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting) as well as many other features.


For styling, I am using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
It was quite challenging at first - I had to open the docs quite regularly but with regular use
I developed muscle memory for the commonly used properties and it made me more productive.
Now I don't have to think about what to name my classes, worry about collisions. It also makes the CSS more maintainable.
The typography plugin is also very helpful.

For hosting, I am using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Vercel is a free hosting platform for individual use.
It is faster than the alternatives, edge functions make sure that you don't need to create a separate backend for
connecting to a DB. It connects directly with Github, updates the builds automatically for every git push
including preview builds for non-main branches, security certificates and more.


For my DB needs, I am using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). Prisma is an ORM for TypeScript.
For hosting the DB I am using [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) which has very generous free tier.


To write the actual content, I am using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
I felt that writing the content in HTML would make me too slow, and Markdown wasn't flexible enough.
MDX allows you to use React components within my markdown files.
Rendering MDX was a bit challenging, even though there are some fantastic open source packages.
I was trying to initially do it via babel loaders, but later on found out a solution using [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)
which made the process much easier.


I am also using [Splitbee](https://splitbee.io/) for analytics. It provides free analytics like how many readers are visiting my blog, whom are they being referred by, what countries they belong to, etc.

  alt={`Splitbee analytics, it shows 2 bar graphs on the top. 1st one with unique users on th y-axis and time on x-axis. Next one with page views on the y-axis and time on x-axis. Then there are also statistics for different things like referrers, country wise, etc.`}

Also much thanks to [Lee](https://leerob.io/). A lot of stuff in this blog is inspired from or directly copied üòÅ from Lee's blog.
